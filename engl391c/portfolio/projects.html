                    Portfolio item 1: The Mortal's Music (Graphite Illustration)
                </h2>

                <p>
                    This piece was also done as an art project for GCSE Art, a still life drawing with graphite pencil.
                    Objects used in the piece were obtained from the environment in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates and my family's old stash of retro technology.
                    The Sony cassette tap and headphones were old and no longer functional, whilst the dry desert hyacinth and animal skull no longer have life to them.
                    I wanted to capture the fragility of those that are mortal, in both the living and non-living, as they are not timeless, only fleeting. However, the
                    cassette tape portrays the lasting of humanity's art and culture, evidently in music.

                    Portfolio item 2: The Choice to Unlock (Monoprint)
                </h2>

                <p>
                    This piece was done as an art project for GCSE Art, where I experimented with monoprinting. 
                    These locks were collected from a local recycling and clean up crew, and I washed and cleaned them to take photographs.
                    The photographs were then engraved onto acrylic plastic to be inked and monoprinted onto canvas paper.

                <p>
                    This logo design was done on Procreate by commission for the Model United Nations club at Cranleigh Abu Dhabi (CADMUN), inspired off of the official United Nations logo.
                    It is now used for social media posts, documents and advertisements.

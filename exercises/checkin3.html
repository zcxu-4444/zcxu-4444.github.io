                    This piece was also done as an art project for GCSE Art, a still life drawing with graphite pencil.
                    Objects used in the piece were obtained from the environment in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates and my family's old stash of retro technology.
                    The Sony cassette tap and headphones were old and no longer functional, whilst the dry desert hyacinth and animal skull no longer have life to them.
                    I wanted to capture the fragility of those that are mortal, in both the living and non-living, as they are not timeless, only fleeting. However, the
                    cassette tape portrays the lasting of humanity's art and culture, evidently in music.

        Valorant Map Attacker VS Defender Sided Guide
    </h1>

        <h3>
            Introduction:
        </h3>
        <p>
            People get generally confused a lot on whether if the map you are playing on is defender sided or attacker sided.
            This generally results into your descending into a debate of if you guys are screwed or not after getting absolutely rolled in the first half.
            You can now rest assured, as now this is a comprehensive guide as to which map is attacker sided or defender sided.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Why is this guide important?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The way you strategize which rounds that have higher priority is a huge factor in keeping certain advantages. 
            Some rounds and specific halves require more attention given whatever situation you are in.
            For example, if you just finished your first half on defender side and are extremely behind in rounds. However, you happen to be playing on Lotus, a notoriously attacker-sided map. Notifying the team of this information is important for a morale boost and an explanation for why things went south. Hence, this information would benefit you in how future rounds are to be played.

    <h2>
        Scaling:
    </h2>
    <p>
        There will be some maps that are heavily attacker/defender sided, some slightly attacker/defender sided, whilst some are neither.
        The general scaling used in this guide would be:
    </p>
    <ol>

        <li>
            Attacker sided
        </li>

        <li>
            Slightly attacker sided
        </li>

        <li>
            Balanced
        </li>

        <li>
            Slightly defender sided
        </li>

        <li>
            Defender sided
        </li>

    </ol>

        Reasons why:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Mid is a nightmare to defend, it is legit who out-aims who wins mid space.
        </li>

        <li>
            It is a huge map, rotating is a nightmare for defenders, and rotating with limited leaked info of it for attackers is a merit.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="bind">Bind</h2>

    <h3>Defender Sided</h3>

        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    Reasons why:
    <ol>
        <li>
            So many tight corners, arguably one of the rattiest maps, sitting in a hookah or u-hall with a shotgun is a sure-fire way to win defense.
        </li>

        <li>
            Sites are have a lot of retake options for post-plant, and once teleports are in defender's control, attackers will struggle playing post-plant, especially after the ping-nerf.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Attacker Sided</h3>

        </figcaption>
    </figure>


    Reasons why:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Two ways to contest both sites, need I say more?
        </li>

        <li>
            It is a huge map, rotating is a nightmare for defenders, whilst attackers can easily double back with tunnel on A and ziplines.
        </li> 

        <li>
            Retake is a nightmare.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Attacker Sided</h3>

        <img src="/Users/cathyxu/Documents/engl391c/images/haven_minimap.jpeg" alt="Map of Haven">

        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    Reasons why:
    <ol>
        <li>
            3 sites, all where attackers can scale up easily as long the defenders don't rush the same main. 
        </li>

        <li>
            Again, it is a big map, rotating is a nightmare for defenders, and rotating with limited leaked info of it for attackers is a merit.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="lotus">Lotus</h2>

    <h3>Attacker Sided</h3>

    <figure>
        <img src="../images/lotus_minimap.jpeg" alt="Map of Lotus">
        <figcaption>
            Image Credit: <a href = "https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/Lotus">Lotus</a>, <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/">Valorant</a> on <a href="https://www.fandom.com/">Fandom</a>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA</a>
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    Reasons why:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Arguably one of the most attacker sided maps ever, Riot had to rework the defender side of sites just to make it more managable.
        </li>

        <li>
            B site is the lurker's treasure cove, if defenders are not careful, a fake push turns into a split, and defenders will die from a bullet to the back of the head.
        </li>

        <li>
            Unfortunately, it is just the nature of 3 sited maps, similar to Haven.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="pearl">Pearl</h2>

    <h3>Slightly Defender Sided</h3>

    <figure>
        <img src="../images/pearl_minimap.jpeg" alt="Map of Pearl">
        <figcaption>
            Image Credit: <a href = "https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/Pearl">Pearl</a>, <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/">Valorant</a> on <a href="https://www.fandom.com/">Fandom</a>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA</a>
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    Reasons why:
    <ol>
        <li>
            As long as mid space is contested and held, holding down sites would make it difficult for attackers to entry. B site has long angles that can easily be held with an Outlaw or an Operator, whilst A site is an easy site for sentinels to defend and util dump the main entry area. 
        </li>

        <li>
            Retaking site is easy to execute if there is mid control, i.e. A Art and B Link. This gives a lot of flood entries for retake from different angles, which would inevitably overwhelm defenders playing site for post-plant.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Slightly Attacker Sided</h3>

        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    Reasons why:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mid is a nightmare to defend, easy to rush, especially with Sentinel's recent strategy in Masters Bangkok, of just rushing and util dumping the heck out of vents. 
        </li>

        <li>
            With a Sage, entering B site and getting plant down to play post-plant will be a breeze.
        </li>

        <li>
            Retakes will be difficult, both sites have a lot of angles to clear and rat areas on A flowers and elbow and B Back, Rafters, and Drop. 
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>
        Valorant Map Attacker VS Defender Sided Guide
    </h1>
        <i>(updated as of February 23rd, 2025)</i>

    <section>
        <p>
            People get generally confused a lot on whether if the map you are playing on is defender sided or attacker sided.
            This generally results into your descending into a debate of if you guys are screwed or not after getting absolutely rolled in the first half.
            You can now rest assured, as now this is a comprehensive guide as to which map is attacker sided or defender sided.
            Plus, credible sources will be linked at the bottom of the page if the guide alone doesn't convince you! :D

        <h4>
            Why is this guide important?
        </h4>
        <p>
            The way you strategize which rounds that have higher priority is a huge factor in keeping certain advantages. 
            Some rounds and specific halves require more attention given whatever situation you are in.
            For example, if you just finished your first half on defender side and are extremely behind in rounds. However, you happen to be playing on Lotus, a notoriously attacker-sided map. Notifying the team of this information is important for a morale boost and an explanation for why things went south. Hence, this information would benefit you in how future rounds are to be played.

    <h2>
        Scaling:
    </h2>
    <p>
        There will be some maps that are heavily attacker/defender sided, some slightly attacker/defender sided, whilst some are neither.
        The general scaling used in this guide would be:
    </p>
    <ol>

        <li>
            Attacker sided
        </li>

        <li>
            Slightly attacker sided
        </li>

        <li>
            Balanced
        </li>

        <li>
            Slightly defender sided
        </li>

        <li>
            Defender sided
        </li>

    </ol>
